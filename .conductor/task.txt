User Story: Resolve PHAN Undeclared Property Error in PHPUnit Codebase

As a PHPUnit developer,
I want to refactor the existing code in src/Framework/MockObject/Runtime/Api/DoubledCloneMethod.php
So that the PHAN error 'PhanUndeclaredProperty' related to the undeclared property '__phpunit_invocationMocker' is resolved without altering any functionality.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The PHAN error 'PhanUndeclaredProperty' for the file src/Framework/MockObject/Runtime/Api/DoubledCloneMethod.php must be resolved.
2. The property '__phpunit_invocationMocker' must be properly declared within the trait 'DoubledCloneMethod' or an appropriate method to handle its invocation must be implemented, ensuring that the property is recognized by PHAN without altering the trait's external behavior.
3. Refactoring must not introduce any new PHAN errors or warnings in the codebase.
4. The solution must be verified by running PHAN static analysis again to ensure that the specific error does not appear.
5. All existing unit tests for the PHPUnit framework must pass, ensuring that the refactoring has not broken any existing functionality.
6. A code review must be conducted for the changes, focusing on adherence to existing coding standards and practices within the PHPUnit project.

Technical Notes:
- The '__phpunit_invocationMocker' property is used within the '__clone' method of the 'DoubledCloneMethod' trait. This property does not seem to be declared within the trait or in any class that uses the trait.
- The developer should investigate the usage pattern of '__phpunit_invocationMocker' within the PHPUnit codebase to determine the best approach for declaring or handling this property.
- Consideration should be given to how '__phpunit_invocationMocker' is initialized and used, ensuring that any changes maintain the current logic and functionality.
- The developer may need to review related classes or traits within the PHPUnit codebase, such as those involved in mock object generation and handling, to understand the context and relationships affecting this property.
- If necessary, consult the PHPUnit documentation or contributors for insights into the intended use and handling of '__phpunit_invocationMocker' and similar properties.
